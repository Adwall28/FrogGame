Froggy is a simple console-based game, which uses a Frog's tongue to try and catch food for the hungry frog. I based it on the classic game 'Snake', but with some added features.


How to Play:

There are a few simple rules

- Use WASD to move the Frog's Tongue
- Catch all the flies (%) you can
-  Beware of all the junk (@) flying around. 
- The junk is poisonous, so eating it will cost you a life
-  You only have 3 lives to spare, so be careful!

 When playing, you can press x at any time to exit!

Although Froggy works as a game, there were some mechanics I would have liked to add, like the tongue looking more like a tongue. 
However, with time restraints, I found it took me too long to figure it out without the main mechanic breaking.
